## Random Quote Machine

A webapp that serves a random quote on demand and allows the user to tweet the quote.

The app must fulfill these user stories:

1. I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
2. I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
When the user presses Tweet quote button it automatically redirects to their twitter page and ask them to tweet the current quote.
The app is built as part of [freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Front-End Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine).
